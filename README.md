# MachineLearning_1i_Nh_1o
[1 input] + [N hidden perceptrons] + [1 output]

This project contains a simple C++ implementation of a Feed Forward Neural Network that contains 1 input, 1 hidden layer with N perceptrons, and 1 output. The code shows how to use both simple backpropagation and non-linear optimization (using https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt) of the network to training data.

The code runs significantly faster than the basic Keras Python implementation.

The code is explained on this web page: https://megamachinelearn.org/backpropagation-part-3-1-hidden-layer-n-perceptrons/
